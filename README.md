<div align="center"> <br/><img src="https://your-screenshot-url.com/main.png" alt="screenshot" /><br/><br/> <p align="justify"> This AI Webscraper captures content from any website by scraping all the DOM elements. It then allows users to input queries that are intelligently handled by a language model (LLM), offering relevant and structured responses based on the scraped content. Whether for automated data extraction or dynamic analysis, the tool simplifies how users interact with web data. </p> </div>
